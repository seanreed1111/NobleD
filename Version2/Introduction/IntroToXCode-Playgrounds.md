			Exercise Overview
Intro To Xcode
Swift is a powerful new programming language for writing applications for iOS devices.
Xcode is the development environment were all of this programming takes place
There are two distinct programming environments in Xcode: Playgrounds and Projects
Playgrounds are great for trying out new concepts and new features you want to learn and a great environment in which to learn and practice Swift.

Projects are the environment where you build and test real working apps. 
All of your design and user interface work MUST take place in projects, since playgrounds don't allow you to build UI. 
Projects can run in the powerful iOS simulator, where you can do initial testing of how your app will behave on real devices.
Projects can also be run on actual devices if you have a paid developer license from Apple. 
The simulator is great for many things, but no developer should EVER submit an app without testing it on actual hardware.
The majority of this course will take place in the playgrounds environment but we will intersperse projects from time to time, particularly those with discussing/using items from the iOS User Interface Kit (UIKit) 
We will create a simple playground first just to give you a clean and simple environment to learn the basics of the Swift language. 
The focus of the next series of exercises is pure Swift done in the playgrounds. 


Later when we get to projects, we'll dive more into a tour of Xcode so you can see the power there. 

			Get Started with a playground
Now let's pull up a playground and begin.

Two different commands can get you there.
    Xcode 
    	> Get Started with a playground
    	> File > New > Playground
