// Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import UIKit

var str = "Hello, UIView, UILabel, UIButton, UIViewControllers"
// let's look at Apple's Developer docs
// make sure everyone is signed up so that they all have access.
// is this just a cruise around apple's docs
// or fire up a project and create all these things and dig around a bit
// make a label
// make a button
// add a new view
// dig around the viewController


// focus is the subclass and superclass aspect of all of this

// UILabel and UIButton have all the functionality of UIViews
