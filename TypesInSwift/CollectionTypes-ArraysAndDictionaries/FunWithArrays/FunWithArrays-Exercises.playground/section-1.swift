var str = "Hello, Arrays"

// Exercises (prerequisites: Loops, if-then-else, append)

// 1) write a program that starts with an array of integers and makes a corresponding array of Bools, true if the integer is even, false if the integer is odd

// example 
// if you get an inputArray of
//inputArray [3,6,8,9]

//then the outputArray is
//outputArray: [Bool] = [false, true, true, false]


// this operation is known as a map.
// please do not use the map function of Swift to do this problem!!

//2) write a program that starts with an array of integers and makes a new array with all integers > 50 removed 

// example
// if you get an inputArray of
//inputArray = [30,60,80,90]

//then the outputArray is
//outputArray = [30]

// this operation is known as a filter.
// please do not use the filter function of Swift to do this problem!!

//3) write a program that starts with an array of integers 
//and computes the product of all the elements in the array

// example
// if you get an inputArray of
//inputArray = [1,2,3,4,5]

//then the output is
//output = 120

// this operation is known as reduce or fold.
// please do not use the reduce function of Swift to do this problem!!
